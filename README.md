I added an eclipse project. 

What you need to do:
revert to Hadoop 2.6.0
Once you do that, use the JAR in the top level, and put it into the "plugins" folder of where Eclipse is installed on your computer. 
This hopefully should give you the option of creating a MapReduce project the next time you load Eclipse. Make a dummy MapReduce project and set the 
location of Hadoop to the 2.6.0 installation. Then you can import this as a Git project. It should take care of everything. Please let me know how this goes. 

NOTE: I believe that Hadoop needs to use the /bin folder.
